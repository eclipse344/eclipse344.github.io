          <h1>Welcome To Nicks Homepage</h1>
          <h2>Tompkins square park has been a very important part of my childhood growing up. Considering the fact that I have lived in manhattan for my whole life and people aren't kidding when the say its the concrete jungle living near a park is something I consider to be a special privilege. Tompkins square park has a special place in my heart for 3 main reasons. Its really close to where all my friends live so we commonly meet there and have had several special conversations there. It has a lot of my favorite food spots near by that my dad used to take me too so it is associated with those memories. And lastly it was one of the main spots I would play chess at. 

	Most of my friends live in stuy town and I live in the east village making Tompkins a good distance from all of us making it perfect for us to all hang out. In addition to it being close it also has a good bit to offer. There are multiple jungle gyms and open fields that serve as a great source of entertainment especially when we were younger. I could not count the memories I made with my best friends that I wouldn't trade the world for. 

	Next off Tompkins is surrounded by some of my favorite food spots. There is a corndog place on 7th and a there is an icecream place on the same street, theres a deli on 6th and a, theres a dollar slice pizza place on 6th and a, theres a place called ralphs italian ice that is nostalgic for my dad because he was a kid when they first opened and he loves taking me there. Overall there are several food spots around Tompkins that make it special. 

	Lastly Tompkins has several chess tables that I used to use to practice. Before I came to nest I used to play on a competitive chess team and in order to stay on the team I needed to practice. While playing inside was nice and had its benefits going to the outside tables was always refreshing. I got to feel the nice breeze (I almost only played chess outside in the spring) and enjoy the sun while waiting for my opponent to take his move. 

	All in all Tompkins square park holds a special place in my heart for all of the reasons above.
